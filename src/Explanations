 Collections vs Arrays
 The disadvantages of an array. Let's walk through some examples and I'll show you. Arrays have a fixed size because
 the space for an array must be allocated for the number of objects that we intend to store. So if I want to declare
 a new room array, I need to know the number of elements that I'll be storing up front. Then I need to store each room
  within its index in the array. This can lead to one-off errors that throw index out of bounds exceptions.
  And if you look closely, you'll notice that we already have one. I wanted to declare an array of size three,
  but instead, I've declared an array of size two. That would have threw an error. Now, when we work with collections,
   we don't have these sorts of problems. It's relatively easy to instantiate a collection and add elements into it.
   You'll notice that I do not have to declare the size of the collection upfront. And if I want to add elements into
   the collection, I don't have to be concerned about a couple of things.
